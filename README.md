## I started this organization back in 2017 in hopes of providing the best care for NYC pets. My passion for working with animals really springboarded my professional career as an entrepreneur and I have dedicated the last 6 years of my life to my business.

## As with any modern business in today's day and age, one of the first steps I took to establish a brand was building a website and solidifying our digital footprint. However, I quickly became frustrated with the limitations of website template platforms and thus began my introduction to the world of coding. The more I learned about this foreign world the more intrigued I became and eventually made the decision to pivot my career toward the tech industry.

## Since then I have attended and graduated from General Assemblys software engineering immersive program in November of 2022 and now I am back to where it all started: my company's website. This website is the culmination of over a years worth of learning and I am incredibly excited to pay homage to the company that has given me so much.
